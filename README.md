## Usage Guide

### 1. Play Game Quests (15 Minutes)

For quests that require playing a game for 15 minutes:

1. **Accept the quest** in Discord
2. **Select "Desktop"** as your platform
3. Go to the **Quest Automation panel**
4. Click **"Detect Quests"**
5. Select the quest from the dropdown
6. Click **"Start"**

> **Note:** There may be a delay in the automation's progress display - this is normal! As long as the progress is updating in Discord's quest page, everything is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Quest not detected?** Make sure you've accepted the quest first and selected a platform

- **Error messages?** Try refreshing Discord (Ctrl+R) and detect quests again
